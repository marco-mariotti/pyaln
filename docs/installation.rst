Installation
------------

We recommend to use the conda package manager to install pyaln
(check `this page to install conda / miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_).
With conda installed, **run this in a terminal to install pyaln**::

  conda install -c mmariotti pyaln

Alternatively, you can use pip::

  pip install pyaln
  
To check that the pyaln installation was successful, run this::

  python -c 'import pyaln'
