    """Compute the sequence identity between two sequences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : str
        first sequence, with gaps encoded as "-"

    b : str 
        second sequence, with gaps encoded as "-"

    gaps : str
       defines how to take into account gaps when comparing sequences pairwise. Possible values:
       - 'y' : gaps are considered and considered mismatches. Positions that are gaps in both sequences are ignored.
       - 'n' : gaps are not considered. Positions that are gaps in either sequences compared are ignored.
       - 't' : terminal gaps are trimmed. Terminal gap positions in either sequences are ignored, others are considered as in 'y'.
       - 'a' : gaps are considered as any other character; even gap-to-gap matches are scored as identities.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        sequence identity between the two sequences
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> sequence_identity('ATGCA',
    ...                   'ATGCC')
    0.8
